# Experimental Data and Reference Results

This directory contains **experimental measurement results and reference
distributions** associated with the execution-structure conditioning
experiments reported in the accompanying paper.

All data in this directory represent **recorded execution outputs** or
derived reference distributions and constitute the primary empirical
basis for the reported analyses.

---

## Scope and Intent

The contents of this directory are provided to support:

- Independent verification of reported results
- Reproduction of figures and metrics
- Auditability of experimental outcomes
- Long-term archival of empirical evidence

This directory contains **data only** and no interpretive or analytical
material. Interpretation of these results is provided separately in
`/reports`.

---

## Organization

Data are organized by experimental test case, with directory names
mirroring those used in `/qasm` and `/reports`.

## Execution Variants

Within each test case, results are grouped by execution variant:

- **baseline/**  
  Measurement outcomes from execution of the unmodified reference circuit.

- **conditioned/**  
  Measurement outcomes from execution of the conditioned circuit artifact.

- **ideal/**  
  Reference outcome distributions used for comparison and normalization.
  These may be analytically derived or simulator-generated and are not
  hardware measurement results unless explicitly stated.

---

## File Descriptions

Typical files within each execution variant include:

- `counts.csv`  
  Aggregated measurement outcome counts.

- `shot_order.csv`  
  Record of per-shot execution order, where applicable.

- `metadata.json`  
  Execution metadata including backend identifiers, timestamps,
  configuration parameters, and run identifiers.

Additional files may be present to support provenance or tooling output.

---

## Data Integrity and Provenance

A `checksums/` directory is provided to support integrity verification
of recorded data files.

All datasets are:
- Generated by executing the corresponding QASM circuits in `/qasm`
- Captured without post-hoc modification
- Referenced by analytical artifacts in `/reports`

Any data processing performed for analysis is non-destructive and
documented outside this directory.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

The data in this directory, together with:
- QASM circuit specifications in `/qasm`
- Experimental metadata in `metadata.json`
- Analytical methods described in `/docs`

are sufficient to reproduce the reported figures and conclusions.

---

## Relationship to Other Directories

- `/qasm` defines the executed circuit artifacts.
- `/reports` contains derived analyses and interpretive materials.
- `/docs` documents experimental protocols and analysis methodology.

This directory serves as the **empirical foundation** of the repository.
